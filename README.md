Business Problem

We, Cheng Mortgage Services, want to improve how we handle home loans. We're facing more customers having trouble repaying their mortgages. To tackle this, we need to make sense of a big dataset from Freddie Mac. But it's tricky because the data is huge and complicated. Cheng Mortgage Services needs a solution to quickly figure out which loans are risky, predict if someone might not be able to pay, and take steps to avoid losing money

Data Sourcing
---
We first acquired the data sets from Freddie Mac's official website, https://www.freddiemac.com/research/datasets/sf-loanlevel-dataset. We specifically picked Loan-Level Dataset Files which are Standard and Annual. Then we chose the sample data sets for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 from the Originating Files. The sample dataset is a simple random sample of 50,000 loans selected from each full vintage year and a proportionate number of loans from each partial vintage year of the Standard Dataset. Included in the file is the User Guide of this data set, which serves as our Data Dictionary. You can access it in Github or through this link:
