Business Problem
---
We, Cheng Mortgage Services, want to improve how we handle home loans. We're facing more customers having trouble repaying their mortgages. To tackle this, we need to make sense of a big dataset from Freddie Mac. But it's tricky because the data is huge and complicated. Cheng Mortgage Services needs a solution to quickly figure out which loans are risky, predict if someone might not be able to pay, and take steps to avoid losing money

Data Sourcing
---
We first acquired the data sets from Freddie Mac's official website, https://www.freddiemac.com/research/datasets/sf-loanlevel-dataset. We specifically picked Loan-Level Dataset Files which are Standard and Annual. Then we chose the sample data sets for the years 2020, 2021, 2022 from the Originating Files. The sample dataset is a simple random sample of 50,000 loans selected from each full vintage year and a proportionate number of loans from each partial vintage year of the Standard Dataset.
